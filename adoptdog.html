        <p class="text">Rocky has recently lost his mistress and is now looking for a new home and a new family to give him love and attention.
        Rocky is four years old, he is from Stara Zagora. He has a passport and all immunizations, healthy and happy. Rocky is
        used to an apartment, loves to walk outside, loves to run and explore the world around him. We want to find really
        loving people to give him attention and care, we do not accept the idea of being constantly tied up in the yard - this
        would be a great stress for the dog.</p>

        <li> Age: 11</li>
    </ul>
<p class="text">
The dog is meek, friendly and social, both with people and other animals, but the long life on the street and the
difficulties of survival has made her a little jealous of food. Of course with other dogs, and she is kind to people.
Felicity is an old but unpretentious lady. He has established hygienic habits. It is mobile, suitable for gentle walks
due to its age and injuries.
